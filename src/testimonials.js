And here is my feedback.\n\nFinally I received the magnificent memory book of “56 FREE SCHOOL STREET” personally signed by the author, my Dear “ZORRO” friend Zorab Ohanessian, for which I’m sincerely grateful.\n\nThe book, dedicated to all those who entered the IRON gates of the Armenian College & Philanthropic Academy at a very young age and left the College in their late teenage or early twenties, to refresh their life long memories they all experienced.\n\nAllow me to confess, that throughout the past, almost two century old School, no one has ever written a wonderful memory book in such detail, which of course, is commendable.\n\nUpon receiving the book, I immediately started to go through it without any delay, as I had been long waiting for, but as I reached the Introduction and read the first two-three paragraphs of it, tears rolled down my face and I simply, couldn’t go on any further. It seemed to me as if, I was reading my own biography. The sad and dreadful memories which, we all have experienced, was once again refreshed.\n\nWhile reading the book with great enthusiasm and heartfelt interest, there were times, which I shed tears and at times, laughed and smiled, whereby surprising my family members for my reactions!\n\nIn my opinion, there was no need for renaming some of the characters in the book, as nothing rude nor insults, were addressed to anyone.\n\nLet me confess, that while reading the book, written in strong English, I had a dictionary by my side, as there were some unfamiliar words to me, which I had to look for.\n\nDEAR ZORAB, THANK YOU! FOR THE WONDERFUL MEMORY BOOK.\nGOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS."

It is a coming of age story of a young boy who finds a new home and new friends.  The author seems to want to pick every detail of life behind the school walls and does so eloquently. There are moments of hope and despair. Some characters seem larger than life for the boarders! Every experience for the author is a lifelong experience that is etched in his memory."

It's an incredible story of adults doing the best they could to save a group of children from the savage world of wars and racial and religious prejudices in the first half of the twentieth century against Armenians in northern Iraq. Sad as it is, the story has its bright spots too, especially since many of those children have lived to be successful and lead exciting and fruitful lives. Highly recommended!"

I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and it made me happy, sad, giggly and all other emotions burst out. I had forgotten about the 'katlos' days. It's very well written and also I got to feel the emotions of my friends which I never felt during my schooling days of how my friends must have felt when we local boarders used to go home once a month.

While reading the book I was able to relate to what my brothers and sisters were so proud of when they were boarders. I like how the author finds himself in an alien country and wonders why he is where he is and what his future holds? Steadily and interestingly the author narrates his struggle and triumphs of events that unfolded in the boarding school way back in the 50's and 60's. An earnest and thoughtful reminiscence of a bygone era."

Congratulations Zorab for your patience to collect all these memories and put them in print for us and future generations to read and remember and appreciate.The book is brilliantly written describing every emotion and sentiment we went through at the college in the 1950's.  Wow!  You seem to remember every single event, movie, actors etc and your description of the boys, girls and staff was so vivid and accurate.  Yes, indeed I just went back 60 years and relived those moments in time, that were painful but we managed to survive and survived well.  The book entails a lot of anecdotes that were sincere, painful but yet inspiring."

It's sad and yet inspiring, and knowing Zorab personally we can see how this tough environment forged his unbendable character and will. One of the truly unique characteristics of the story is that it depicts a global historic character of Armenian people: a boy born in the Middle East, studies in India and continues to live his adult life in the US.

Book gave me a good idea of what boys endure at boarding school from the first day up until graduation; in addition, it perfectly describes what it means to be stripped from one's  immediate family but that the same time, as years go by, how a new one is created.  The writer of this book did a wonderful job at relating his story and,  in my experience, was able to successfully create a mental picture of what went on while he attended this school. "

A well told, witty, true, thoughtful, sad, but entertaining insight into education and life being a boarder where students came from afar and did not see their parents and siblings for many years. The story depicts the true challenges in life. Highly recommended read!"

After I read your book, personally I felt guilty for not understanding the boys and girls that came to Calcutta for studies, not understanding their personal feelings & pain of separation. After reading your well written book, I thought WHY didn’t our head teachers and principal take the trouble to explain to us or have the overseas students tell us their feelings their stories, their separation, their anxiety, their experiences of life in Calcutta. What a wasted opportunity by all of us in Calcutta to learn from the overseas students. Sorry! Love to all the overseas students past and present."

You have not only been able to capture and connect the lifestyle of boarders of your time but have managed to connect all those boarders who have been in Armenian College even after your time. I would say even ex students who have graduated in recent years will easily connect to your accounts of school life.\n\nA very vivid recollection of the past that is embedded in the memory of the author that is there right through the end. A childhood memory that is engraved so deeply in the memories of the author that it refuses to fade away even after over half a century. A book that has the potential to become a film.\n\nA must read for any boarder who has had a boarding school life. The book stands as a testimony of camaraderie to the fullest of a group of boarders and their journey of a life time.\n\nOne will find it easy to read and connect with the characters in the book who are interestingly charming, fearless, loving and forgiving.\n\nYou won’t want to stop reading once you start… a raw account of boarding school life filled with twists and turns, engaging and challenging.\n\nIt reads like a story where one finds asking himself as to who one should love and who should one sympathize with or fear. The author leaves the choice to the reader to make up their own mind as to who they want to love and who they’d rather dislike or want them to stay on for a little longer.\n\nA poignant account of brotherhood, friendship, love and hate relationship. It’s an account that one at times finds it hard to believe it’s a true story.\n\nEvery Armenian College past and present student should read this book. Even though you may have graduated in different decades the stories of our school and the events are easily related. Things and events that took place in the 50’s also took place in the 80’s and 90’s.\n\nFrom having the same sporting games to prefect selection criteria, school events, girls’ and boys’ relationships, to the willingness of the church attendance, to favorites and no so favorite moments, food, lifestyle and the list can go on… It is a must read!"
